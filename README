# Possible Jekyll bug related to #7811

This is an example Jekyll site to help investigate a bug that is possibly related to issue [#7811](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7811)

When the Jekyll site is created the page at /news/browse.html should list the months that have news items. In this example site it should just list December 2019 and January 2020 in a bulleted list. These items should then link through to the month listings - one page each for for December 2019 and January 2020 (these in urn have links to the individual news posts).

The /news/browse.html page and the two month pages (/news/122019.html and /news/012020.html) are generated by a custom plugin: _plugins/news-month-listings.rb

However, the /news/browse.html page is created using an incorrect _layout by the custom plugin. Instead of using _layouts/news_browse.html as specified in the custom plugin it's using _layouts/news_by_month.html

Further information can be found on the root index.html page of the generated site.
